# RISCV-VP-Space-Invaders
A bare metal implementaion of space Invaders for a RISCV VP

It's a simplified implementation of space invaders to run on the following RISC-V virtual prototype:
[ICS SystemC RISCV VP](https://github.com/ics-jku/riscv-vp-plusplus)

It's written in C and uses the framebuffer for the VP, which printes the output over VNC.
